# **Sales Data Analysis Project for a Medical Supplies Company**

This project focuses on analyzing sales data to derive insights about product performance, customer behavior, and relationships between products, ultimately leading to the development of a recommender system for a medical supplies company. The analysis is conducted through several stages, employing data preprocessing, aggregation, and distance computation methods to identify trends and correlations. Additionally, we will:

- **Utilize Cosine Similarity for Product Descriptions**
- **Build a Popularity-Based Recommender System**
- **Implement a Recommender System using Matrix Factorization**
